# Interpreting Results

## Output Files 

 Explain the structure and content of BLIPSS outputsâ€”candidate lists, periodicity detection reports, diagnostic plots.

## Candidate Verification

Provide guidelines on how to classify candidates, cross-match signals between different observing sessions, and differentiate plausible technosignatures from terrestrial RFI.

## Advanced Analysis

Advanced Analysis: Discuss optional post-processing steps (e.g., folding data, further statistical analysis, or applying machine learning filters).
