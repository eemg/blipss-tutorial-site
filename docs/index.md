# BLIPSS Tutorial

Welcome to the BLIPSS tutorial site! Here you will learn how to set up, run, and analyze Breakthrough Listen data using BLIPSS.

## What is BLIPSS?

`blipss` is a CPU-based open-source software that targets the detection of narrowband periodic
radar transmissions from potential technologically advanced alien life forms residing in the
Universe. It uses a fast folding algorithm (FFA) to uncover channel-wide periodic
signals in radio dynamic spectra.
