# BLIPSS Tutorial

Welcome to the BLIPSS tutorial site! Here you will learn how to set up, run, and analyze Breakthrough Listen data using BLIPSS.

## What is BLIPSS?

`blipss` is a CPU-based open-source software that targets the detection of narrowband periodic
radar transmissions from potential technologically advanced alien life forms residing in the
Universe. It uses a fast folding algorithm (FFA) to search for channel-wide periodic signals in radio dynamic spectra.

## What is the purpose of this website?

The main objectives of this tutorial are: (1) to provide a clear, step-by-step workflow for analyzing periodic signals in
radio spectra, (2) to guide users through the installation, configuration, and operation of BLIPSS, and
(3) to support the interpretation of BLIPSS outputs and candidate evaluation. A more detailed
description of this project can be found [in this report](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6764d8d8d6989f9fa2f345a1).
