## Data Format

Explain the structure of the input data (e.g., filterbank files, metadata, frequency-time intensity arrays).

## Preprocessing Steps

Describe RFI excision, bandpass calibration, dedispersion (if relevant), and other standard radio astronomy data cleaning steps.

## Running Initial Scripts

Show how to run a basic preprocessing script that prepares data for the BLIPSS pipeline.
