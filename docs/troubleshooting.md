###Package dependencies -- `riptide-ffa`

If you try to install the required packages by running the `setup.py` script in the `blipss` repo,
you'll most likely encounter the following error when trying to install the `riptide-ffa` package:

```
No eggs found in /var/folders/wf/7jsqb_s54gd_0rxyxk7ctypnjry76x/T/easy_install-l9smnw03/riptide-ffa-0.2.5/egg-dist-tmp-9j7h1xjk (setup script problem?)
error: The 'riptide-ffa>=0.2.4' distribution was not found and is required by blipss
```

This can be avoided by manually installing each package as described
[here](getting_started.md#package-dependencies).
